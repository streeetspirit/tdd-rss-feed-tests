# RSS feed testing Project4 Udacity FEND
Assignment #4 from Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

For this project the application that grabs feeds and displays them for several feeds was developed by Udacity and ready to use.
Jasmine was included (I'd use fresher version but I guess that was more convenient to have everything prepackaged already)

# Running RSS feed tester on your computer
